This is the firmware for the SPIDriver.
It uses the [MyForth](http://www.kiblerelectronics.com/myf/myf.shtml) compiler written by
Charley Shattuck and Bob Nash.

To compile the fonts go into ``st7735s``
and unpack the [IBM Plex OpenType](https://github.com/IBM/plex/releases) font set.
then run ``mkfont.py``. This builds the font sources in ``fonts.fs``
